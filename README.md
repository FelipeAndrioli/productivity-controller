# Productivity Controller

## About the project

This project is about create a productivity controller,
where you can add some "routines" with softwares, navigator links
and a timer.

Each routine need to be created previously, setting what softwares
and links to open, the useless softwares and links is going to be
closed.

You can create how many routines you need, let's have an example:

	-> Work
	-> Hobbie Work
	-> Game Time!
	-> Studie Time!
	-> Home Office

I think you already get the idea.

## Project steps

The project is going to have 3 main steps:

	- Script to open Software and Links
	- Script menu to select wich routine execute
	- Adapt to a software with a GUI


## Final considerations

The project does not have monetary goals, I just want to stack knowledge
and do it because I want.
